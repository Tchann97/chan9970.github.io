                        For my Computer Architecture class we wrote a program in C that converts MIPS code into machine code. It takes in the file of MIPS operatins from the Lynux command line and it works with the data. Using bit shift it converts the line into machine code and writes the data into another file.

                    <p>
                        I created a java program that simulated the Tenzi game. It had allowed the user to roll 10 die and then it displayed the values of all ten die. It then allowed the user to choose which die to roll again. Once al the die had the same number it recorded the time it took since the start of the game and added it to a leaderboard which showed the top three times.

                        I created a java program that modeled a coffee kiosk. It allowed the customer to user to pick which coffee or tea they wanted and it inlcuded any add ons that the user would like to add. During the selection process the customer was able to view the price of each item and the amount of calories that each drink would have considering the add ons.

                        I created a java program that implemented the monte carlo strategy for the number tic tac toe game. Before playing any moves the program would use different threads to simulate 300 games and calculate the next move with the best percentage of winning.

                        I created a Java program that modeled the number tic tac toe game. It allowed the user to select an a opponent which could be another player, a program that picked random moves, or a Monte Carlo player that would use th monte carlo strategy to pick its moves. The game would display the board and the available moves and numbers to choose from.

                    <p>
                        I created a to-do list program that modeled a to-do list. It would allow the user to type in their user name and pull up their an option menu. On the option menu the program would allow the user to add items to do and enter a due date and their importance level. It would then be able to display the exiting to do items by their importance level or by thier date.
